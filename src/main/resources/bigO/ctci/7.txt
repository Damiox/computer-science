Exercise #7
***********

Which of the following are equivalent to O(N)? Why?
1) O(N + P), where P < O(N / 2)
2) O(2N)
3) O(N + log N)
4) O(N + M)

Solution
********

Answer is 1, 2 and 3.

1) P is dependant of N, and it's always less than N => O(N)
2) dropping constant => O(N)
3) N is the dominant term because it'll always grow more than log N => O(N)
4) no relation between N and M, then we can't reduce this => O(N + M)
