Exercise #VI6
*************

int sqrt(int n) {
    for (int guess = 1; guess * guess <= n; guess++) {
        if (guess * guess == n) {
            return guess;
        }
    }
}

Solution
********

Time Complexity:

sqrt(16)
    1 <= 16
        4 <= 16
            9 <= 16
                16 <= 16
                found 4!

=> O(âˆšn)

Space Complexity: O(1)
