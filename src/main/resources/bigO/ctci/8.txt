Exercise #8
***********

Suppose we had an algorithm that took in an array of strings, sorted each string, and then sorted the full array.
What would the runtime be?

Solution
********

Pseudocode to depict the algorithm:

function {
    for (i = 0 ; i < A.length ; i++) {
        S = A[i];
        sortString(S);
    }
    sortArray(A);
}

1) sortString time complexity is for the best sorting algorithm: O(S * log S)
2) sortArray time complexity is, again, for the best sorting algorithm: O(A * log A), but we need to compare strings,
so we need to take that comparison into account, that would be O(S * A * log A)
3) To sum up, this would take:
3.a) O() = O(A * S * log S + S * A * log A)
         = O(S * A * (log S + log A))
