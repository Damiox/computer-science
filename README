Hi!, my name is Damian Nardelli and I am a Software Engineer.
This is my personal repo to keep track of my computer science-related exercises.
You will find here solutions to some CS problems that I gathered through CTCI, geeksforgeeks.org and Hackerrank.com

Note: you may find this code useful, but please take into account that because of the essence we are doing some nasty things.
For instance, we are violating the `Encapsulation` OOP fundamental / principle when implementing some data structures without defining setter/getters methods.
I was not thinking purely in OOP when I did these execises. I was mainly focused on the Big O, correctness and code simplicity.
At the same time, I wanted to have a single java file for each of these problems.
